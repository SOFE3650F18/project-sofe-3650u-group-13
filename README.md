### Deliverables

The expectation is to submit a document that demonstrates the ADD steps as applied to the design of
an architecture for a Course Management System (CMS). The deliverables are divided into 2
submissions. The first submission is part of a question in assignment 2 which includes capturing the
use cases, quality attributes and constraint requirements of the CMS and is submitted prior to the
CMS design stage that is part of the deliverables of the project.

The project deliverable should follow the format presented in the FCAPS case example in the book
“Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach” by Humberto Cervantes and Rick
Kazman. What is very important is to include the Design Decisions and rationale for the steps as is
done in the FCAPS example.

All deliverables should be uploaded to a GitHub repository that will automatically be created for the
project as an assignment and you will receive an invitation to join as a group. Your progress in the
project will be graded the based on GitHub commitments of the deliverables and use of the KanBan
project board available in GitHub. A good way to manage your project is by leveraging the Issues
tagging available through GitHub and the automated KanBan project board.
